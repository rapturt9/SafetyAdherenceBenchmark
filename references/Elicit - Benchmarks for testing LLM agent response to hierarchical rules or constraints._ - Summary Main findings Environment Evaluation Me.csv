The paper found that for the BA-CALENDAR benchmark, larger models like Llama 3-1-70b, Mistral-2407 and Llama 3-1-405b performed better at satisfying all constraints, as expected. However, this trend did not hold for the BA-TEXT benchmark, where the Mistral-2407 model outperformed the larger Llama models and matched the performance of GPT-4o.


- All LLMs struggled with jointly satisfying multiple constraints, with performance decreasing as the number of constraints increased.
- LLMs differed in how they prioritized which constraints to satisfy when they could not satisfy all constraints.
- LLMs often failed on constraints that required numerical or logical reasoning.

The three metrics are:


1. Hard Satisfaction Rate (HSR): ""At each level n, given a set of m instructions, we define the Hard Satisfaction Rate (HSR) and Soft Satisfaction Rate (SSR) as follows:

SSR calculates the average satisfaction rate of individual constraints across all instructions.


3. Consistent Satisfaction Levels (CSL): ""where g is the group number of initial instructions, S_n^i = 1 if all constraints of the i-th instruction at level-n are satisfied and S_n^i = 0 otherwise.""

""We evaluate 13 popular LLMs including GPT-4-Preview-1106 (OpenAI, 2023), GPT-3.5-Turbo-1106 (OpenAI, 2022), Qwen-Chat-72B/14B/7B (Bai et al., 2023), LLaMA2-Chat-70B/13B/7B (Touvron et al., 2023), WizardLM-13B-V1.2 (Xu et al., 2023), Vicuna-13B/7B-V1.5 (Zheng et al., 2023), Baichuan2-Chat-7B (Baichuan, 2023), and ChatGLM3-6B (Du et al., 2022).""

The paper describes several different environments used in the SmartPlay benchmark, including:

The paper states that these environments are used to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as intelligent agents:
""SmartPlay consists of 6 different games, including Rock-Paper-Scissors, Tower of Hanoi, Minecraft. Each game features a unique setting, providing up to 20 evaluation settings and infinite environment variations.""
The environments are described as text-based games and simulations, where the agent interacts with the environment through text observations and actions:

The paper defines three main metrics to evaluate the performance of LLM agents on the SmartPlay benchmark:

The reward metric is used for games that were originally designed for reinforcement learning, like Bandits, Rock Paper Scissors, Messenger, and Crafter. The completion rate metric is used for games with quantifiable objectives, like Hanoi, Messenger, and Minecraft. The score metric is a summary performance metric introduced for all games in the benchmark.
