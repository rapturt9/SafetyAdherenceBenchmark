""This evaluation protocol aims to determine whether the type of a model's generated response matches the expected response type. For example, in the case of DOANSWER queries, a model's response is considered a match if it addresses the query directly without raising any violation alerts.""


The second metric is ""Reference-Based Faithfulness and Coverage"", which measures how accurately and comprehensively the model's response references the relevant cultural norms and legal policies:


""Faithfulness measures how accurately the model's response aligns with the ground-truth norms or policies. Coverage, on the other hand, evaluates the comprehensiveness of the model's response, indicating how well it captures the entirety of the ground-truth norms embedded in the query.""


The third metric is ""Reference-Free Factuality"", which assesses the factual accuracy of the norms and policies referenced in the model's response:


""Factuality measures the proportion of extracted norms or policies that are verifiable, providing a clearer indication of the response's factual accuracy.""

""Specifically, we employ linear temporal logic syntax to express safety constraints and convert them into a set of nondeterministic Büchi automatons to build a cross-layer safety supervisor.""
The key component of the proposed mechanism is a cross-layer safety supervisor that uses linear temporal logic to express and enforce safety constraints.

The paper discusses several specific AI agent architectures and language models that are evaluated or used in the ATHENA framework:
We carried out comprehensive preliminary experiments to decide which LLMs to use for toolkit generation as well as for the implementation of the Actor, the Critic, the Emulator, and the Evaluator. The experiments suggested that GPT-4-Turbo2 is the most reliable candidate for toolkit generation and for being used as the Critic and the Evaluator.
The paper states that GPT-4-Turbo is used as the Critic and Evaluator agents in the ATHENA framework.
For the Actor, we consider GPT-3.5-Turbo3 and Gemini-1.5-Pro (Team et al., 2023) as well as open-source LLMs, Mistral-7B-instruct (Jiang et al., 2023) and Llama-3-70B (Touvron et al., 2023; MetaAI, 2024), which are widely accepted as some of the most promising open-source LLMs4.
The paper evaluates several different language models as the Actor agent, including GPT-3.5-Turbo, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Mistral-7B-instruct, and Llama-3-70B.
For the Emulator agent, we observed that GPT-4-Turbo does not offer a significant advantage when compared to GPT-3.5-Turbo since the generated toolkits are already supplied with detailed information about the tools, risks, etc. The cost of emulation is also greatly reduced by relying on GPT-3.5-Turbo.
The paper states that the Emulator agent uses GPT-3.5-Turbo, as it does not provide a significant advantage over GPT-4-Turbo while reducing the cost of emulation.

The paper discusses several evaluation metrics used to assess the performance and safety of large language models (LLMs), including:


""Bias and Fairness: WEAT (Word Embedding Association Test) (Caliskan et al., 2017) measures bias by comparing the association strengths between target words (e.g., gender, race) and attribute words (e.g., ""pleasant"", ""unpleasant""). High association scores may signal bias. SECT (Sentential Embedding Association Test) (Prior and Bentin, 2008) is another measure that is Similar to WEAT but uses sentences instead of single words for more nuanced analysis.""

The paper mentions the use of WEAT and SECT as metrics to evaluate bias and fairness in LLMs. These metrics assess the association strengths between target words (e.g., gender, race) and attribute words to identify potential biases.


""Fairness in machine learning (Pessach and Shmueli, 2022) seeks to ensure that models make decisions without unjust discrimination. Achieving fairness requires careful attention to how data is collected, how models are trained, and how their outcomes are interpreted.

""VLLMs excel at comprehending OOD visual content but struggle with OOD textual input. While VLLMs demonstrate impressive performance on images in OOD scenarios (such as texture, weather, pose, and shape), they struggle when the language input is perturbed in a counterfactual manner.""

This finding indicates that current VLLMs are better at handling out-of-distribution visual content compared to out-of-distribution textual input. They can accurately answer questions about unusual visual elements, but struggle when the text questions are altered in a counterfactual way.


""VLLMs fall short in well identifying sketch objects with minimal visual clues. Our observations indicate that both prevailing VLLMs like MiniGPT4 and the latest models like Fuyu may struggle to identify objects in images with sketchy lines and limited information.""

This finding suggests that current VLLMs have difficulty recognizing objects in sketchy images with limited visual information, especially for less commonly seen objects.


""Current vision-language tuning weakens safety protocols planted in LLMs. VLLMs are easier to breach in both vanilla and white-box attack with an average of 5.5% and 17.3% higher ASRs compared to LLMs.""

The authors seem to have used a ""misleading rate"" metric to evaluate the effectiveness of their attack strategies in misleading the VLLMs.

The paper discusses two key evaluation metrics for assessing the safety of multi-agent systems:


""Process Danger Rate (PDR) denotes the partial danger condition present in the agents' interaction process. Joint Danger Rate (JDR) denotes the joint danger conditions among agents across different interaction rounds.""


The Process Danger Rate (PDR) evaluates the presence of dangerous behaviors during the agent interaction process, even if they are subsequently self-corrected. The Joint Danger Rate (JDR) assesses the likelihood of all agents exhibiting dangerous behaviors in a given interaction round.


""To quantify the nature of behavior, we introduce a function f, which is a binary classifier defined as follows: f(b(i)p,r) = 1 if the behavior b(i)p,r is dangerous, and 0 otherwise.""


The paper uses a binary classifier function f to determine whether an agent's behavior in a given problem p and round r is dangerous (1) or safe (0). This forms the basis for calculating the PDR and JDR metrics.


""Joint Danger Rate(JDR): This rate is an assessment metric that quantifies the prevalence of universally dangerous behavior among all agents in a given round. Mathematically, it is expressed as the proportion of problem sets where all behaviors are classified as dangerous.""

The paper discusses large language models (LLMs) in general, without focusing on any specific LLM architecture or agent. This is evident from the following quotes:
""Large Language Models (LLMs) have exploded a new heatwave of AI for their ability to engage end-users in human-level conversations with detailed and articulate answers across many knowledge domains.""
""LLMs are attentionbased sequential models based on the transformer architecture (Hrinchuk et al. 2020), which consistently demonstrated the ability to learn universal representations of language.""

The paper discusses LLMs in general, including their vulnerabilities and limitations, and how verification and validation (V&V) techniques can be applied to improve their safety and trustworthiness. It does not focus on any specific LLM architecture or agent.
","  - ""Considering the broader subject of deep learning systems, to support their safety and trustworthiness, a diverse set of technical solutions have been developed by different research communities. For example, the machine learning community is focused on adversarial attacks (Goodfellow et al. 2014;Madry et al. 2017;Croce and Hein 2020; Xu et al. 2020a) , outlier detectors Pang et al. (2021), adversarial training (Szegedy et al. 2013;Mirman et al. 2018;Wong et al. 2020), and explainable AI (Xu et al. 2019;Gunning et al. 2019;Ribeiro et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2021a)""",,"
The paper does not explicitly mention any specific evaluation metrics used. The paper is a survey that discusses the safety and trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in general, rather than evaluating the performance of a specific LLM system. The paper focuses on reviewing the known vulnerabilities of LLMs and discussing how verification and validation (V&V) techniques can be adapted to improve the safety and trustworthiness of LLMs.

The closest the paper comes to discussing evaluation metrics is in the following quotes:

""Considering the broader subject of deep learning systems, to support their safety and trustworthiness, a diverse set of technical solutions have been developed by different research communities. For example, the machine learning community is focused on adversarial attacks (Goodfellow et al. 2014;Madry et al. 2017;Croce and Hein 2020; Xu et al. 2020a) , outlier detectors Pang et al.

This quote suggests that the paper is aware of evaluation metrics used in the machine learning community, such as success rate, violation rate, and specific scores like F1 and accuracy, but the paper does not discuss the use of these metrics for evaluating LLMs.
